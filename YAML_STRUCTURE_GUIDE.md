# üìã YAML Structure Guide for Agentic Companion

## üéØ Overview

This guide provides the optimal structure for YAML files that will be processed by our embedding and RAG system. Each subject category has specific requirements for optimal chunking and retrieval.

## üèóÔ∏è General Structure Principles

### **Chunking Strategy**

- **Size**: 50-200 words per chunk (optimal for embeddings)
- **Context**: Each chunk should be self-contained
- **Metadata**: Rich metadata for filtering and retrieval
- **Hierarchy**: Logical grouping within subjects

### **Metadata Fields**

```yaml
# Standard metadata for each chunk
metadata:
  subject: "values" # Subject category
  type: "chunk" # Content type
  source: "values.yaml" # Source file
  confidence: 0.9 # Confidence score (0-1)
  tags: ["personal", "core"] # Searchable tags
```

## üîß **Processing Guidelines**

### **Chunking Rules**

1. **Natural breaks**: Split at logical boundaries (sections, items)
2. **Size limits**: Keep chunks between 50-200 words
3. **Context preservation**: Ensure each chunk is self-contained
4. **Metadata richness**: Include relevant tags and attributes

### **Tagging Strategy**

- **Subject-specific**: Use tags relevant to the content
- **Search-friendly**: Include common search terms
- **Hierarchical**: Use both broad and specific tags
- **Consistent**: Maintain consistent tag naming

### **Quality Metrics**

- **Completeness**: Each chunk should be meaningful on its own
- **Relevance**: Content should be directly related to the subject
- **Specificity**: Avoid vague or generic statements
- **Authenticity**: Reflect genuine personal experience and beliefs

---

## üìù **Example Processing**

### **Input YAML**

```yaml
values:
  core_principles:
    - value: "Continuous Learning"
      description: "I believe in constantly expanding knowledge and skills"
      examples: ["Reading daily", "Taking courses", "Learning from failures"]
      importance: 0.95
      tags: ["growth", "education", "improvement"]
```

### **Generated Chunks**

```yaml
- id: "values_core_learning_1"
  text: "Continuous Learning: I believe in constantly expanding knowledge and skills. Examples include reading daily, taking courses, and learning from failures. This is a core principle with 95% importance."
  metadata:
    subject: "values"
    type: "principle"
    source: "values.yaml"
    tags: ["growth", "education", "improvement"]
    importance: 0.95
```

---

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Create subject-specific YAML files** following these structures
2. **Test chunking** with the RAG system
3. **Validate embeddings** quality and retrieval
4. **Iterate and refine** based on performance

This structure ensures optimal processing by our embedding and RAG system while maintaining rich, searchable content for the agentic companion.
