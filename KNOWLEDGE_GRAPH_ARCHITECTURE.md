# 🧠 Knowledge Graph Architecture: Hybrid Approach

## 🎯 Overview

The agentic companion uses a **hybrid knowledge graph architecture** that combines explicit structured relationships with implicit semantic embeddings. This approach provides the best of both worlds: precise, interpretable connections and flexible, discovery-based relationships.

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### **1. Explicit Knowledge Graph (YAML Cross-References)**

**Storage**: YAML files with structured cross-references
**Purpose**: Precise, human-readable relationships

```yaml
# Example from data/projects/lumi.yaml
cross_references:
  - type: outgoing
    target_category: preferences
    target_file: movies
    connection_type: ai_interest
    relevance_score: 0.8
    description: AI interest connects lumi to movies

  - type: incoming
    source_category: career
    source_file: technical_skills
    connection_type: ai_interest
    relevance_score: 0.8
    description: AI interest connects technical_skills to lumi
```

**Benefits:**

- **Interpretable**: Clear, human-readable relationships
- **Queryable**: Can be traversed programmatically
- **Metadata Rich**: Connection types, relevance scores, descriptions
- **Stable**: Explicit relationships don't change with embedding updates

### **2. Implicit Knowledge Graph (Vector Embeddings)**

**Storage**: Vector embeddings in semantic space
**Purpose**: Flexible, similarity-based relationships

```python
# Example embedding with cross-reference context
chunk_text = """
Lumi is an AI-powered platform for seed book tracking
Related: AI movies (Interstellar, The Matrix),
AI books (consciousness, ethics),
Bitcoin projects, Python/ML skills
"""

chunk_embedding = embed(chunk_text)  # Vector in high-dimensional space
```

**Benefits:**

- **Semantic Similarity**: Captures implicit relationships through vector space
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Finds related content even without explicit links
- **Scalable**: Can discover new relationships through similarity
- **Performance**: Fast retrieval through vector search

## 🔄 How They Work Together

### **Query Processing Flow**

```
User Query: "What AI projects am I working on?"

1. Explicit Graph Traversal:
   - Find direct links to AI projects (lumi, stackr, revao)
   - Follow cross-references to related content
   - Retrieve structured relationship data

2. Implicit Graph Search:
   - Search vector embeddings for AI-related content
   - Find semantically similar chunks
   - Discover implicit connections

3. Combined Response:
   - Merge explicit and implicit results
   - Rank by relevance scores
   - Generate rich, interconnected response
```

### **Complementary Strengths**

| Aspect               | Explicit Graph           | Implicit Graph       | Combined |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | -------- |
| **Precision**        | High (exact matches)     | Medium (similarity)  | High     |
| **Discovery**        | Low (manual creation)    | High (automatic)     | High     |
| **Interpretability** | High (readable)          | Low (vectors)        | High     |
| **Performance**      | Medium (graph traversal) | High (vector search) | High     |
| **Flexibility**      | Low (structured)         | High (fuzzy)         | High     |

## 📊 Current Implementation

### **Cross-Reference Statistics**

- **Total Connections**: 90
- **Connection Types**: 3 (ai_interest, bitcoin_interest, freedom_value)
- **Files Enhanced**: 9 files across 4 categories
- **Bidirectional Links**: Both incoming and outgoing references

### **Connection Types**

#### **1. AI Interest (72 connections)**

```yaml
connection_type: ai_interest
relevance_score: 0.8
description: AI interest connects [source] to [target]
```

**Examples:**

- Projects → Movies (AI themes in Interstellar, The Matrix)
- Projects → Books (AI ethics, consciousness literature)
- Projects → Technical Skills (Python, machine learning)

#### **2. Bitcoin Interest (12 connections)**

```yaml
connection_type: bitcoin_interest
relevance_score: 0.8
description: Bitcoin interest connects [source] to [target]
```

**Examples:**

- Projects → Books (Bitcoin philosophy, economics)
- Projects → Work Experience (Bitcoin development)
- Books → Work Experience (Bitcoin-related skills)

#### **3. Freedom Value (6 connections)**

```yaml
connection_type: freedom_value
relevance_score: 0.85
description: Freedom value connects [source] to [target]
```

**Examples:**

- Movies → Shows (freedom themes in Westworld, Game of Thrones)
- Movies → Books (freedom and sovereignty literature)
- Shows → Books (autonomy and independence themes)

## 🚀 Learning Mode Integration

### **Dynamic Knowledge Graph Updates**

During learning mode, the system will:

1. **Process User Interactions**

   ```python
   def process_interaction(query, response, feedback):
       # Extract insights from interaction
       insights = extract_insights(query, response, feedback)

       # Identify new connections
       new_connections = identify_new_connections(insights)

       # Update cross-references
       update_cross_references(new_connections)

       # Regenerate embeddings
       regenerate_embeddings()
   ```

2. **Discover New Connections**

   - Analyze query-response patterns
   - Use semantic similarity to find new relationships
   - Apply pattern matching to identify connections
   - Score and filter new connections

3. **Update Both Graph Layers**
   - **Explicit Graph**: Add new cross-references to YAML files
   - **Implicit Graph**: Regenerate embeddings with new context
   - **Synchronization**: Ensure both layers remain consistent

### **Example Learning Scenario**

```
User: "I really enjoyed working on the Bitcoin integration in Lumi"
Response: "That's great! Your Bitcoin work connects to your interest in financial sovereignty..."

Learning Mode Processing:
1. Extract Insight: "Bitcoin integration" + "Lumi" + "financial sovereignty"
2. Discover Connection: Lumi project ↔ Freedom values (financial sovereignty)
3. Update Cross-References: Add new connection to YAML files
4. Regenerate Embeddings: Update chunk context with new connection
```

        # 2. Implicit graph search
        implicit_results = self.search_embeddings(user_query)

        # 3. Combine and rank results
        combined_results = self.combine_results(explicit_results, implicit_results)

        # 4. Generate response
        response = self.generate_response(combined_results)

        return response
```
